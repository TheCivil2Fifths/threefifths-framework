## The Argument

The Three-Fifths Clause didn't say Black people were 60% human. It said slaves were 0% citizen.

Madison wrote that the Constitution regards the slave as "divested of two fifths of the MAN." That word, *divested*, is the exact term of art from Hobbes, Locke, and Grotius for the stripping of rights. It implies a whole from which something has been removed. Not diminished to. Not equivalent to. *Divested of.*

This essay argues that the 3/5 fraction aligned with a philosophical architecture already present in the Western tradition: a distinction between **natural personhood** (body, soul, mind) and **civic belonging** (liberty, standing). Every source Madison and his contemporaries studied contains this distinction. The slave codes encoded it into law. Madison's own vocabulary, across decades of writing, describes it.

3/5 is what remains when the civic person is removed. It is a remainder, not a ratio of value.

## What the Framework Claims

- The philosophical tradition distinguished natural personhood from civic membership
- Slavery stripped civic standing while acknowledging natural humanity
- The slave codes explicitly encoded this: "natural justice" applied to the enslaved, yet they were "chattels personal"
- Madison's own words map onto this architecture: "moral rank," "rank & rights," "divested of two fifths of the MAN"
- Free Black people counted as 5/5 under the Constitution, confirming the fraction tracked legal status, not race
- The 1790 census drew the line at "free persons" vs. "slaves," not at skin color

## What It Does Not Claim

- That Madison sat down and listed five components of personhood
- That the fraction was a deliberate philosophical encoding
- That body, soul, and mind each "equal" one-fifth of a person
- That the philosophical architecture *caused* delegates to choose 3/5 rather than another fraction
