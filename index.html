<h2 id="argument">What This Argument Is (And What It Isn't)</h2>
<p><strong>The Weak Claim (not what I'm arguing):</strong>
"The Founders had a secret 5-part theory of humanity, and 3/5 was a deliberate encoding of it."</p>
<p><strong>The Strong Claim (what I am arguing):</strong>
"The 3/5 fraction emerged from political negotiation, but it <em>stuck</em> because it aligned with a philosophical architecture that distinguished natural personhood from civic belonging, a distinction visible in Locke, Blackstone, the slave codes, classical philosophy, and Madison's own writings. The Western philosophical tradition that Madison and his contemporaries absorbed identified natural components of the person (body, soul, mind) and civil ones (liberty, standing). This framework explains why fractional counting of enslaved people felt defensible to men steeped in social contract theory, natural law, and Christian theology, and why 3/5 became a durable coordination point once it was on the table, not because the tradition uniquely <em>derives</em> 3/5, but because it made a fraction like it feel philosophically coherent."</p>
<p>The difference matters. The weak claim requires a smoking gun, some document where Madison lists five components of personhood. No such document exists. The strong claim requires demonstrated alignment across the philosophical tradition these men knew, Madison's own vocabulary, and the legal architecture of slavery. That evidence exists.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="misconception">The Common Misconception</h2>
<p>The Three-Fifths Compromise is widely misunderstood as a claim that the Founding Fathers believed enslaved people were literally "three-fifths of a human" in terms of inherent worth. This interpretation, while morally resonant, misrepresents what was actually a political negotiation about representation and taxation.</p>
<p>But dismissing the fraction as "mere political horse-trading" creates its own problem: not why 3/5 specifically, political negotiations land on all sorts of numbers, but why fractional counting of human beings was <em>thinkable</em> at all, and why 3/5 became the focal point once it was introduced. The Congressional record makes that problem harder, not easier.</p>
<h3>What the Record Shows, and What It Doesn't</h3>
<p>The 3/5 ratio originated in 1783, when the Confederation Congress debated switching from land-value taxation to population-based taxation. The question: should enslaved people count in the population that determined a state's tax burden? Several fractions were proposed:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Benjamin Harrison (Virginia):</strong> 1/2 &mdash; FAILED</li>
<li><strong>New England delegates:</strong> 3/4 &mdash; FAILED</li>
<li><strong>James Madison:</strong> 3/5 &mdash; passed Congress, failed ratification</li>
</ul>
<p>Madison's recorded justification was a single sentence. His legislative diary states that "Slaves should be rated as 5 to 3" because of the "property difference between the labor and industry of free inhabitants, and all other inhabitants."<sup id="fnref:2-1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-1">1</a></sup> A productivity claim, slave labor produces 3/5 of what free labor produces. No data was cited. No economic study was referenced. No methodology was recorded for arriving at that specific number rather than any other.</p>
<p>The amendment failed (New Hampshire and New York opposed it). Four years later, at the Constitutional Convention in 1787, Charles Pinckney and James Wilson recycled the old 1783 number, but now for <em>representation</em>, not taxation. The political dynamics had completely flipped: the South, which had wanted a <em>lower</em> count in 1783 to reduce its tax burden, now wanted a <em>higher</em> count to increase its congressional seats. Yet nobody recalculated. They reached for the old fraction.</p>
<p>That reuse matters. Once 3/5 had passed Congress in 1783, it became a ready-made coordination point. It was already debated, already written down, and already understood as a plausible compromise. In 1787, when time and coalition math mattered more than theoretical purity, path dependence did the rest.</p>
<p>What happened next is remarkable for what it <em>doesn't</em> contain. These were among the most intellectually rigorous men of their generation, men who debated the structure of the Senate, the scope of the veto, and the treaty power with exhaustive philosophical reasoning drawn explicitly from Montesquieu, Locke, and the classical tradition. Yet on the specific fraction that would shape American politics for eighty years, the floor debate records:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>James Wilson</strong> (who proposed it): <em>"did not well see on what principle the admission of blacks in the proportion of three fifths could be explained."</em><sup id="fnref:2-2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-2">2</a></sup> He then asked: if they are citizens, why not equal? If property, why count at all?</li>
<li><strong>Nathaniel Ghorum:</strong> called 3/5 <em>"pretty near the just proportion"</em><sup id="fnref:2-3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-3">3</a></sup>, proportion of what? He does not say.</li>
<li><strong>Elbridge Gerry:</strong> said 3/5 was <em>"the full proportion that could be admitted"</em><sup id="fnref:2-4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-4">4</a></sup>, of what? Does not say.</li>
<li><strong>Gouverneur Morris</strong> put the binary objection most forcefully: <em>"Are they men? Then make them Citizens and let them vote. Are they property? Why then is no other property included?"</em><sup id="fnref:2-5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-5">5</a></sup> Morris could not see past the binary: person or property, pick one. Neither could the government he was building. But Madison could plausibly read the problem through a tradition that treated the human as both natural creature and civil subject, a person who could be one in law and another in status.</li>
<li><strong>Butler and Pinckney</strong> moved to strike "three fifths" entirely and count enslaved people equally with whites (5/5 for representation). Their motion failed.</li>
<li>A vote on <strong>2/3 failed 6-5</strong>. Then 3/5 passed 9-2.<sup id="fnref:2-6"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-6">6</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>Nobody on record explains the philosophical principle that distinguishes 3/5 from 2/3. Nobody explains why the same fraction suited both taxation (where it measured productivity) and representation (where it measured something else entirely). Wilson, who introduced the motion, admitted on the floor that he could not explain its principle.</p>
<h3>The Silence at the Convention</h3>
<p>The coalition math explains how 3/5 assembled enough votes. It does not explain why these men, who argued everything else from first principles, left <em>this</em> fraction philosophically unjustified. Three explanations are possible, and intellectual honesty requires presenting all of them:</p>
<p><strong>Explanation A (the contingency reading):</strong> The number was a political artifact. 3/5 had already been adopted once, in 1783. Recycling it avoided reopening a painful negotiation. The delegates were exhausted, the compromise was available, and nobody wanted to debate the fraction when larger structural questions remained unresolved. The silence reflects pragmatism, not implicit agreement on a philosophical architecture.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation B (the path-dependence reading):</strong> A previously adopted fraction became the lowest-friction choice in a hard negotiation. Once 3/5 existed as a precedent, it functioned as what Thomas Schelling called a "focal point", a coordination solution that negotiators converge on because it is already salient, not because it is uniquely optimal.<sup id="fnref:2-7"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-7">7</a></sup> The silence reflects the gravitational pull of an existing number, not philosophy.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation C (the tacit-framework reading):</strong> The reasoning was embedded in a shared intellectual framework so familiar it didn't require articulation. The natural/civil distinction, between what a person is by nature and what civil society grants, was foundational to every text these men had studied. Fractional counting mapped onto that distinction without anyone needing to spell out the mapping.</p>
<p>These explanations are not mutually exclusive. Path dependence can explain why 3/5 <em>survived</em> from 1783 to 1787. The philosophical tradition can explain why fractional counting <em>felt defensible</em> once it was on the table. Neither explanation can be proven from the record alone. What can be demonstrated is that Explanation C is <em>available</em>, that the philosophical tradition provides exactly the architecture needed, and that Madison's own vocabulary, across decades of writing, consistently describes enslaved personhood in terms drawn from that tradition rather than from political economy. This framework focuses on why the fraction felt defensible once it surfaced, even if its survival owed as much to coordination and convenience as to philosophy.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="question">The Question</h2>
<p>In Federalist No. 54, Madison wrote that the Constitution regards the slave as "divested of two fifths of the MAN."<sup id="fnref:2-8"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-8">8</a></sup> He framed the argument as coming from "one of our Southern brethren", a rhetorical distancing device. But the persona is thin cover: Madison proposed the 3/5 ratio himself in 1783 and defended it throughout. Scholars including Garry Wills (<em>"Negro President"</em>) and Jack Rakove (<em>Original Meanings</em>) have argued this "ventriloquism" barely conceals Madison's own position.<sup id="fnref:2-9"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-9">9</a></sup></p>
<p>Regardless of authorial distance, the language is precise. "Divested of" means stripped, removed. "Two fifths" implies a whole divisible into five parts. This is not casual vocabulary. "Divested" is the exact term of art from the natural-law tradition Madison knew: Hobbes wrote "to Lay Downe a mans Right to any thing, is to Devest himselfe of the Liberty,"<sup id="fnref:2-10"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-10">10</a></sup> Locke wrote "divests himself of his natural liberty,"<sup id="fnref:2-11"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-11">11</a></sup> Grotius wrote "divested themselves of the Right."<sup id="fnref:2-12"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-12">12</a></sup> Madison was applying a term from the philosophical tradition he had spent years mastering.</p>
<p>The phrasing rationalizes a done deal, but the choice of rationalization reveals how the deal was made thinkable. A full MAN from whom two fifths have been <em>removed</em>. Not diminished to. Not equivalent to. Divested of.</p>
<p>Madison never listed what those five parts were. No 18th-century document provides a "Table of Five Components of Personhood."</p>
<p>But the philosophical traditions Madison knew, Lockean social contract theory, Blackstone's legal categories, classical philosophy, Christian theology, all distinguished between what humans possess by nature and what civil society grants. The slave codes of Virginia and South Carolina explicitly encoded this distinction into law. And Madison's own words, across Federalist 54 and decades of private correspondence, reveal the same architecture.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="madison">Madison's Own Words</h2>
<h3>Federalist No. 54 (1788), The Keystone</h3>
<p>Madison described the enslaved person not as subhuman but as occupying two categories at once: "they partake of both these qualities: being considered by our laws, in some respects, as persons, and in other respects as property."<sup id="fnref:2-13"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-13">13</a></sup> He called the slave "a moral person, not as a mere article of property" and "a member of the society, not as a part of the irrational creation."<sup id="fnref:2-14"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-14">14</a></sup> The slave is a moral person, possessing conscience, reason, membership in the human community. What has been stripped is not the humanity but the civic standing.</p>
<h3>The "Property" Essay (1792), The Closest Thing to an Enumeration</h3>
<p>Four years after Federalist 54, Madison published an essay in the <em>National Gazette</em> defining property "in its larger and juster meaning."<sup id="fnref:2-15"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-15">15</a></sup> He enumerated what a man has property in:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"a man has a property in his opinions and the free communication of them."
"He has a property of peculiar value in his religious opinions, and in the profession and practice dictated by them."
"He has a property very dear to him in the safety and liberty of his person."
"He has an equal property in the free use of his faculties and free choice of the objects on which to employ them."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Five things: (1) opinions, the mind's convictions, (2) religious opinions, the soul's conscience, (3) safety and liberty of person, the body's integrity and the natural freedom inherent in personhood, (4) free use of faculties, civic agency, the right to exercise one's capacities, (5) free choice of objects, civic participation, the right to direct one's efforts.</p>
<p>A caveat on the mapping: Madison's third item, "safety and liberty of person", bundles bodily safety with personal liberty, a compound phrase that does not divide as neatly as the framework might wish. "Safety of person" maps to the body; "liberty of person" straddles the natural/civil line. The phrase likely refers to what Blackstone called the "natural liberty" inherent in personhood, the baseline freedom of the embodied self, rather than the civic liberty that political membership grants.<sup id="fnref:2-16"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-16">16</a></sup> The distinction between natural liberty (the freedom you possess simply by existing) and civil liberty (the freedom to participate in governance) was one Blackstone drew explicitly. But the mapping is not seamless, and the reader should hold this joint loosely.</p>
<p>The broader pattern is suggestive rather than conclusive: the first three items (opinions, conscience, the embodied person) are attributes the slave retains as natural endowments, while the last two (free use of faculties, free choice of objects) are civic exercises that slavery strips. But this is an interpretive reading of an essay about property rights, not a decoder ring. Madison did not write the "Property" essay as a theory of fractional personhood. The alignment is striking enough to note and too imprecise to treat as proof. It is one piece of evidence among several, not the keystone.</p>
<p>Madison then wrote: "Where an excess of power prevails, property of no sort is duly respected. No man is safe in his opinions, his person, his faculties, or his possessions."<sup id="fnref:2-17"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-17">17</a></sup> Under tyranny, all components are endangered. Under slavery, the first three persist as natural attributes even when not "safe", but the last two are stripped entirely.</p>
<h3>The Letters, Madison Quantifies the Civic Deficit</h3>
<p>Decades later, in private correspondence, Madison described what the civil deficit actually costs.</p>
<p>To Edward Coles (1819), arguing that emancipation without social integration would leave freed people worse off: "Without this they seem destined to a privation of that moral rank &amp; those social blessings, which give to freedom more than half its value."<sup id="fnref:2-18"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-18">18</a></sup> Madison is not calculating a precise fraction here, "more than half" is a general claim about the importance of social belonging, not a quantitative statement about two-fifths. But what matters for the framework is not the number: it is what Madison identifies as missing. "Moral rank" and "social blessings", standing and civic membership, are the things whose absence makes legal freedom hollow. The vocabulary is consistent with the framework even if the arithmetic is loose.</p>
<p>To Lafayette (1820): even in free states, Black people face "disqualifications which degrade them from the rank &amp; rights of white persons."<sup id="fnref:2-19"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-19">19</a></sup> Rank and rights, two civic things. For the enslaved, stripped entirely. For free Black people, not stripped but <em>degraded</em>, watered down. Madison's own word is "degrade," not "deny." He is describing a spectrum: the enslaved have the civil 2/5 removed; free Black people have it diminished. Full freedom requires both rank and rights at full strength. Slavery zeroes them out. Nominal freedom without social acceptance dilutes them.</p>
<p>These are the civic components of the framework expressed in Madison's own language, decades after the compromise, still using the same vocabulary: <strong>rank</strong> (standing) and <strong>rights</strong> (liberty). And Madison himself recognized that these components operate on a gradient, not a binary switch but a dial that slavery turns to zero and prejudice turns partway down.</p>
<h3>The Convention, Madison Knew the Tension</h3>
<p>At the Convention itself, Madison revealed his internal conflict. On August 25, 1787, he said it was "wrong to admit in the Constitution the idea that there could be property in men."<sup id="fnref:2-20"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-20">20</a></sup> He knew the enslaved were persons, not property. Yet the political compromise required treating them as both, hence the "mixt character" language in Federalist 54. The 3/5 was his generation's attempt to resolve this tension mathematically.</p>
<p>And on June 30, he named the real divide: "the real difference of interests lies not between the large and small but between the northern and southern states. The institution of slavery and its consequences form the line of discrimination."<sup id="fnref:2-21"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-21">21</a></sup> Not size, not commerce, slavery. The entire constitutional framework bent around this fact.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="framework">The Framework</h2>
<h3>The Natural/Civil Binary, The Core Claim</h3>
<p>Before enumerating specific components, the foundational claim must be stated clearly:</p>
<p><strong>Western political philosophy from antiquity through the 18th century distinguished between natural personhood and civic belonging. These are separable. A person can possess the first without the second. Slavery is the condition of possessing natural personhood while being denied civic belonging. Every source Madison and his contemporaries studied contains this distinction.</strong></p>
<p>This claim is not controversial. It is the default architecture of Locke, Blackstone, Grotius, Hobbes, Puffendorf, Hooker, and Roman law. Hooker stated it most directly: "Members of a Christian Commonwealth have a triple state; a natural, a civil, and a spiritual."<sup id="fnref:2-22"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-22">22</a></sup> And he theorized what partial civic death looks like in practice: "He that by way of punishment loseth his voice in a publick election of Magistrates, ceaseth not thereby to be a Citizen; a Man disfranchised may notwithstanding enjoy as a Subject the common benefit of Protection under Laws and Magistrates."<sup id="fnref:2-23"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-23">23</a></sup> A disfranchised man remains a citizen, counted but not empowered. This is the logic of fractional civic personhood stated explicitly, a century and a half before the Convention, by an author Madison recommended for the Congressional library.</p>
<p>The question is not whether the distinction existed, it is whether and how it maps onto the 3/5 fraction.</p>
<h3>The Five Components of "the MAN"</h3>
<p><strong>Natural Capacity (The 3/5, Retained)</strong></p>
<p>What every human possesses by birth, what even slaveholders could not deny:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Body</strong> &mdash;  Physical existence, inhabitancy, the capacity for labor and suffering</li>
<li><strong>Soul</strong> &mdash;  Conscience, religious capacity, the moral sense that makes a person accountable before God</li>
<li><strong>Mind</strong> &mdash;  Reason, judgment, the deliberative faculty that distinguishes humans from "the irrational creation"</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Civil Capacity (The 2/5, Stripped by Slavery)</strong></p>
<p>What civil society grants, and what slavery withheld:</p>
<div class="note"><p><em>(A note on the math: the framework does not claim that the body is "worth" one-fifth, or that the soul equals 20% of a person. The five components are not weighted equally like slices of a pie. The fraction describes a structural division: the "Human Creature", three natural components, remains after the law strips away the "Citizen", two civic components. 3/5 is what is left when the civic person is removed. It is a remainder, not a ratio of value.)</em></p></div>
<ol>
<li><strong>Liberty</strong> &mdash;  The free exercise of one's faculties, self-governance, the right to direct one's own actions</li>
<li><strong>Standing</strong> &mdash;  Membership in the civic body, rank, recognized belonging to the polity</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Liberty</strong> answers: <em>What can you do?</em> The philosophical tradition speaks with one voice on this point. Locke: the slave has "forfeited their lives, and with it their liberties."<sup id="fnref:2-24"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-24">24</a></sup> Hobbes: external impediments "may oft take away part of a mans power to do what hee would."<sup id="fnref:2-25"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-25">25</a></sup> Aristotle: the slave is "qualified to become the chattel of another person... who has just reason enough to know that there is such a faculty, without being indued with the use of it."<sup id="fnref:2-26"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-26">26</a></sup> Rutherforth, Thomas Rutherforth (1712-1771), Regius Professor of Divinity at Cambridge, whose <em>Institutes of Natural Law</em> (1754-56) was a standard English commentary on Grotius widely read among the founding generation and cited in early American courts, provides the most precise formulation: "slavery deprives the RIGHT to exercise them, not the faculties themselves."<sup id="fnref:2-27"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-27">27</a></sup> The faculties persist. The right to use them does not. (Grotius's <em>De Jure Belli ac Pacis</em>, which Rutherforth's <em>Institutes</em> expounded, was on Madison's 1783 recommended library list for Congress.) Beccaria quantifies it: citizens surrender "portions of liberty" to form society, liberty as divisible, measurable.<sup id="fnref:2-28"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-28">28</a></sup> The slave has surrendered all of it.</p>
<p><strong>Standing</strong> answers: <em>Who do you count among?</em> Again, the tradition speaks with one voice. Locke: the slave "cannot be considered as any part of civil society."<sup id="fnref:2-29"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-29">29</a></sup> Hobbes: the slave has "no obligation at all", outside the covenant entirely, retaining the natural right to "break their bonds, or the prison; and kill, or carry away captive their Master, justly."<sup id="fnref:2-30"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-30">30</a></sup> Grotius: "The State is a compleat Body of free Persons, associated together to enjoy peaceably their Rights, and for their common Benefit."<sup id="fnref:2-31"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-31">31</a></sup> The slave is governed but not governing, present but not counted among that body. Blackstone: man has two aspects, "man as a creature" (natural being) and "man as a citizen" (civil being), and the slave undergoes "civil death," alive in body but dead in law.<sup id="fnref:2-32"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-32">32</a></sup> Aristotle: "in a city there must necessarily be many slaves, sojourners, and foreigners; but from those who are really part of the city and properly constitute its members"<sup id="fnref:2-33"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-33">33</a></sup>, the slave is <em>in</em> the city but not <em>of</em> it.</p>
<p>The two are independently variable. A person can have liberty without standing, a free person in the wilderness, recognized by no polity. A person can have standing without liberty, a prisoner in their own city, recognized but not free. The slave lacks <em>both</em>. This independent variability is not hypothetical: Madison himself describes free Black people as having liberty but degraded standing (the Lafayette letter), and the legal condition of white women under coverture was standing without full liberty.</p>
<h3>A Note on the Lockean Mapping</h3>
<p>This framework draws on the <em>structure</em> of Locke's natural/civil distinction, the division between what humans possess before political society and what political membership grants, rather than mapping his categories one-to-one. The alignment is architectural: Locke distinguishes a pre-political human condition from a civic one, and the slave codes operationalized exactly that distinction. The specific five components I identify are drawn from the convergence of classical philosophy (the tripartite soul), the slave codes themselves, Madison's own vocabulary, and the theological debates, not from any single source.</p>

<h2 id="evidence">The Documentary Evidence</h2>
<h3>The "Natural" Three (Body, Soul, Mind)</h3>
<p><strong>South Carolina Slave Code of 1740:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"And whereas natural justice forbids, that any person of what condition soever should be condemned unheard... some convenient method and form of trial should be established..."<sup id="fnref:2-34"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-34">34</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This acknowledges enslaved people as moral agents capable of crime, recognizing their mind and conscience. You cannot try property for murder. The law recognized the natural human.</p>
<h3>The Soul's Civic Weight, and the Sixty-Year Campaign to Kill It</h3>
<p>Early colonial legal thinking recognized that Christians enslaving Christians was problematic. English common law had no framework for it. Richard Hooker, whose <em>Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity</em> was among the texts Madison recommended for Congress, had written: "The Church and the Commonwealth are in this case therefore personally one Society."<sup id="fnref:2-35"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-35">35</a></sup> Church membership equaled commonwealth membership. If your slave joins the church, your slave joins the commonwealth. If your slave joins the commonwealth, your slave has standing. The logic chain was clear, and slaveholders knew it.</p>
<p>This was not a hypothetical fear. In 1655, <strong>Elizabeth Key</strong>, a baptized Christian woman of mixed race, sued for her freedom in Virginia, and <strong>won</strong>, partly on the basis of her baptism.<sup id="fnref:2-36"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-36">36</a></sup> Other enslaved people made similar claims. The legal precedent was real: baptism had civic weight. The soul conferred standing.</p>
<p>The colonial legislatures' response proves the framework was operative. They didn't argue that baptism <em>shouldn't</em> confer standing. They <strong>legislated</strong> that it no longer would, and it took three separate interventions across sixty years to kill the logic chain:</p>
<p><strong>Virginia, 1667:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Baptisme doth not alter the condition of the person as to his bondage or freedome; that diverse masters, freed from this doubt, may more carefully endeavour the propagation of christianity."<sup id="fnref:2-37"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-37">37</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The statute's own language reveals the problem: masters were <em>doubting</em>, refusing to baptize enslaved people because they feared it would free them. That fear was legally rational. The legislature had to break the link by force of law. Note the bargain: we sever the soul's civic weight so that masters will allow the soul to be saved. The natural person (saveable) and the civil person (still enslaved) are split apart by statute.</p>
<p><strong>Virginia, 1705:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"...all servants imported and brought into this country, by sea or land, who were not christians in their native country... shall be accounted and be slaves. And as such be here bought and sold notwithstanding a conversion to christianity."<sup id="fnref:2-38"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-38">38</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The 1667 law wasn't enough. The 1705 code went further by making the criterion about <em>origin</em>, not current status: "not Christians in their native country." Your conversion after arrival counts for nothing. Only your religious and national membership before importation matters. But the code reveals its own logic: if you WERE a Christian in your native country, you had a potential claim to exemption, not because of your skin color, but because of your prior membership in a Christian commonwealth. The criterion is civic belonging, defined through religion and nationality.</p>
<p><strong>Edmund Gibson, Bishop of London, 1727:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Christianity... does not make the least Alteration in Civil Property."<sup id="fnref:2-39"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-39">39</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sixty years after the 1667 statute, Bishop Gibson was still publicly reassuring slaveholders that baptism would not free their slaves. The fear persisted for six decades because the underlying logic was sound. His letter is a PR campaign for a legal fiction that everyone knew was a fiction: saving the soul <em>should</em> confer standing, but we have agreed that it will not. The Bishop isn't hiding the distinction between natural and civil personhood. He's advertising it.</p>
<p>The explicit separation is worth stating plainly: the soul can be saved, Bishop Gibson <em>wants</em> it saved, without granting the enslaved person any civic recognition whatsoever. Spiritual personhood and civil personhood are completely separate. That is the natural/civil split, stated not by a philosopher in a treatise but by a bishop in a letter to slaveholders, as policy.</p>
<p>Three interventions, 1667, 1705, 1727, to neutralize a single logic chain. The soul had civic weight. The slaveholders knew it. The legislatures had to break the mechanism by force of law because the mechanism <em>worked</em>. This is not a footnote in the history of slavery. It is direct evidence that the civic component of personhood, specifically religious standing as a form of civic belonging, was so legally real that it took decades of legislation to deactivate.</p>
<h3>The "Civil" Two (Liberty, Standing)</h3>
<p><strong>South Carolina Slave Code of 1740:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"...all Negroes and Indians... shall be deemed, held, taken, reputed and adjudged in law, to be chattels personal, in the hands of their owners... to all intents, constructions and purposes whatsoever."<sup id="fnref:2-40"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-40">40</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Chattels personal", property, not persons. This explicitly strips both liberty (faculties directed entirely by the master) and standing (no legal personhood in civil proceedings).</p>
<h3>The Roman Foundation</h3>
<p>The architecture behind the slave codes and the 18th-century sources did not originate with Locke or Blackstone. It came from Rome.</p>
<p>Roman law codified graduated personhood two millennia before the Constitutional Convention. The jurist Gaius wrote: "The main distinction in the law of persons is that all men are either free or slaves."<sup id="fnref:2-41"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-41">41</a></sup> Justinian's <em>Institutes</em> formalized the tripartite division: "All our law relates either to persons, or to things, or to actions."<sup id="fnref:2-42"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-42">42</a></sup> The <em>persona</em>/<em>res</em> distinction, person versus thing, was the foundational legal split that every subsequent Western legal system inherited.</p>
<p>But Roman law did not stop at a binary. It recognized <strong>degrees</strong> of civic death through the doctrine of <strong><em>capitis deminutio</em></strong>, literally "diminution of the head" (legal personality):</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Grade</th>
<th>What Is Lost</th>
<th>Example</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Maxima</strong></td>
<td>Liberty + citizenship + family</td>
<td>Enslavement, capture in war</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Media</strong></td>
<td>Citizenship + family (liberty retained)</td>
<td>Banishment, deportation</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Minima</strong></td>
<td>Family ties only</td>
<td>Adoption, emancipation from household</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This is graduated personhood as formal legal doctrine, centuries before Aristotle's four-tier deliberative faculty, and millennia before the 3/5 clause. A Roman citizen could lose civic standing in stages. <em>Capitis deminutio maxima</em>, enslavement, swept away all rights of citizenship and all family rights. The enslaved person underwent total civic annihilation while remaining biologically alive. This is Blackstone's "civil death" with a Roman name.</p>
<p>Yet even Roman slaves were not legally nothing. The slave could accumulate a <em>peculium</em>, a de facto patrimony that functioned as property even though the slave could not legally own anything. Slave unions (<em>contubernium</em>) had "nothing essential to a Marriage wanting," as Grotius noted, yet Roman law refused to call them marriages.<sup id="fnref:2-43"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-43">43</a></sup> The slave could be punished for crimes, meaning the law recognized moral agency, but could not bring suit, testify against a citizen, or hold office. Roman slavery was fractional personhood in practice: acknowledged as human for purposes of punishment and religion, denied as persons for purposes of law and governance.</p>
<p>And Rome created the intermediate category that Madison would later describe for free Black people: the <strong><em>libertinus</em></strong> (freedman). Freed slaves gained legal freedom but not full citizenship. They owed their former masters <em>obsequium</em> (respect and deference), could not bring legal actions against their patrons without special permission, and were barred from holding certain offices. They were free with an asterisk, the civic 2/5 partially restored but not fully. Madison's description of free Black people "degraded from the rank &amp; rights of white persons" maps precisely onto the Roman freedman's condition: liberty without full standing.</p>
<p>The Roman architecture was not background noise. It was curriculum. Puffendorf drew the connection explicitly: "The Roman Lawyers ordinarily restrain the word Person to those that are Free: and rank their Slaves amongst the Goods they possessed."<sup id="fnref:2-44"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-44">44</a></sup> Jefferson was famously immersed in Roman legal and political models; Madison's own library contained Roman texts alongside Grotius, Blackstone, and Puffendorf, who cited Roman sources on nearly every page. The <em>persona</em>/<em>res</em> distinction, <em>capitis deminutio</em>, the <em>libertinus</em> as intermediate category, all of it flowed into the 18th-century natural-law tradition that shaped the Constitutional Convention.</p>
<h3>The Philosophical Sources</h3>
<p>The philosophical tradition Madison and his contemporaries absorbed, including texts Madison recommended for the Congressional library in 1783, the same year Congress adopted the 3/5 ratio, converges on the same architecture the slave codes and Roman law encoded. Not one relevant source lacks the natural/civil distinction. Taken together, they describe a person whose natural humanity persists under slavery while civic personhood is destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>Grotius</strong> provides the most direct mapping of what persists: slaves, "tho of a different Condition, in Regard to the Body, are, as to the Mind and Religion" equal, different in circumstance, not in nature.<sup id="fnref:2-45"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-45">45</a></sup> And he defines the civic body the slave is excluded from: "The State is a compleat Body of free Persons, associated together to enjoy peaceably their Rights, and for their common Benefit."<sup id="fnref:2-46"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-46">46</a></sup> The slave exists inside the state's jurisdiction but outside its constitutive membership.</p>
<p><strong>Locke</strong> names both what is retained and what is lost. The slave has "forfeited their lives, and with it their liberties, and lost their estates; and being in the state of slavery, not capable of any property, cannot in that state be considered as any part of civil society."<sup id="fnref:2-47"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-47">47</a></sup> Stripped of every civil attribute. Yet Locke insists all humans are "the workmanship of one omnipotent, and infinitely wise maker; all the servants of one sovereign master"<sup id="fnref:2-48"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-48">48</a></sup>, the natural person, God's creation, persists beneath the civic destruction. Locke's three-tier taxonomy of power makes the graduation explicit: paternal power governs children (has property but cannot manage it), political power governs citizens (has property in own disposal), and despotical power governs slaves ("stripped of all property").<sup id="fnref:2-49"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-49">49</a></sup> Three statuses of personhood: child (temporarily incomplete), citizen (complete), slave (stripped).</p>
<p><strong>Blackstone</strong>, the legal bible for Madison's generation, gives this the force of legal doctrine. Man has two aspects: "These regard man as a creature, and point out his duty to God, to himself, and to his neighbour... But municipal or civil law regards him also as a citizen."<sup id="fnref:2-50"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-50">50</a></sup> A man can be a creature without being a citizen. And Blackstone describes "civil death", a person "absolutely dead in law, and his next heir shall have his estate"<sup id="fnref:2-51"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-51">51</a></sup>, biologically alive but civilly annihilated. Blackstone's concept of the denizen, a person "in a kind of middle state between an alien, and natural-born subject" who "partakes of both of them"<sup id="fnref:2-52"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-52">52</a></sup>, explicitly models partial civic standing: the denizen can take lands by purchase but cannot inherit, cannot serve in Parliament, cannot hold office. Civic standing exists on a spectrum: alien (minimal), denizen (partial), naturalized subject (nearly full), natural-born (full).</p>
<p><strong>Puffendorf</strong>, whose <em>De Officio Hominis et Civis</em> ("On the Duty of Man and Citizen") separates "Man" from "Citizen" in its very title, states it most plainly: "a slave is a man for all that."<sup id="fnref:2-53"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-53">53</a></sup> And the principle extends across all civic rank, when describing a nobleman who loses his title, Puffendorf writes: "if a Nobleman be degraded, he only forfeits the Rights of his Order, but the Benefits he holds from Nature, remain perfect and unimpaired."<sup id="fnref:2-54"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-54">54</a></sup> The mechanism is the same whether the divestiture is from noble to common or from free to slave: civic status is lost, natural endowment persists. Puffendorf establishes three distinct layers of personhood: man (governed by natural law/reason), citizen (governed by civil law), and Christian (governed by divine revelation). A human being is simultaneously all three kinds of subject, but each layer can be present or absent independently.</p>
<p><strong>Hooker</strong>, whose <em>Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity</em> Madison recommended for Congress, provides the single most explicit statement of layered personhood: "Members of a Christian Commonwealth have a triple state; a natural, a civil, and a spiritual."<sup id="fnref:2-55"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-55">55</a></sup> The natural state "is cut off" only by death. But the civil and spiritual states can be severed independently. And as noted above, Hooker theorizes what fractional civic standing looks like in practice, the disfranchised man who remains a citizen, counted but not empowered.</p>
<p><strong>Hobbes</strong> places the slave entirely outside the social contract. The slave has "no obligation at all" and "may break their bonds, or the prison; and kill, or carry away captive their Master, justly."<sup id="fnref:2-56"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-56">56</a></sup> No covenant, no duty, no membership. Yet Hobbes insists on natural equality: "Nature hath made men so equall, in the Faculties of the Body, and Mind."<sup id="fnref:2-57"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-57">57</a></sup> The natural person is equal. The civic person does not exist.</p>
<p><strong>Rutherforth</strong>, introduced above, reinforces the point with the explicit claim that liberty is "alienable in whole as well as in part."<sup id="fnref:2-58"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-58">58</a></sup> Counting humans as fractions was not a conceptual innovation of 1783. It was the application of an existing architecture.</p>
<p>The tripartite division of the natural person (body, soul, mind) does not map directly onto Plato's tripartite soul, which divides reason, spirit, and appetite, with the body separate from and inferior to the soul entirely. Nor does it map onto Aristotle's vegetative, sensitive, and rational capacities. The body/soul/mind framework as a description of the <em>whole person</em> is more properly Christian and Pauline, "spirit and soul and body" (1 Thessalonians 5:23)<sup id="fnref:2-59"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-59">59</a></sup>, a formulation that ran through the theological tradition the Founders knew. What Plato and Aristotle <em>did</em> contribute is the principle that the person has distinguishable components, some higher and some lower, and that these components can be present in different degrees. The specific three-part division of body, soul, and mind as the <em>natural</em> person is a synthesis drawn from the convergence of classical philosophy, Christian theology, and the natural-law tradition, not a direct citation of any single source. The two civil components stripped by slavery, liberty and standing, appear in every single source. The convergence is not selective. It is the default architecture of Western political philosophy from antiquity through the 18th century.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="douglass">Convergent Testimony: Frederick Douglass</h2>
<p>The philosophers theorized it. The slave codes encoded it. Madison used the vocabulary. Frederick Douglass lived it, and described it in the same terms, from the other side.</p>
<p>A note on probative weight: Douglass wrote decades after the compromise and was steeped in the same biblical and theological tradition that shaped the philosophical sources. His vocabulary alignment may reflect shared intellectual inheritance rather than independent confirmation. What makes his testimony valuable is not that he "discovered" the framework independently, but that a man describing slavery from lived experience reached for the same conceptual categories, body, soul, mind; person vs. thing; faculties retained but exercise denied, that the philosophers had used from the outside. The tradition was not merely an academic exercise. It described something real enough that both the theorists and the subjected arrived at the same description.</p>
<p>Douglass chose the epigraph for his second autobiography, <em>My Bondage and My Freedom</em> (1855), with precision: "By a principle essential to Christianity, a PERSON is eternally differenced from a THING; so that the idea of a HUMAN BEING, necessarily excludes the idea of PROPERTY IN THAT BEING."<sup id="fnref:2-60"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-60">60</a></sup> A passage from Coleridge, the <em>persona</em>/<em>res</em> distinction, the same Roman legal foundation the philosophers drew on, framing the story of a man who had been classified as <em>res</em>.</p>
<p>When Douglass described what slavery did to him under the slave-breaker Covey, he named the three natural components:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I was broken in body, soul, and spirit. My natural elasticity was crushed, my intellect languished, the disposition to read departed, the cheerful spark that lingered about my eye died; the dark night of slavery closed in upon me; and behold a man transformed into a brute!"<sup id="fnref:2-61"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-61">61</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Body, soul, spirit, biblical language (1 Thessalonians 5:23), not Lockean, then a sentence later, the intellect (mind). The result: "a man transformed into a brute." Not destroyed. Transformed. The humanity persists underneath; what slavery produces is a person forced to function as an animal. Elsewhere he cried out: "O, why was I born a man, of whom to make a brute!" Born a man, the natural 5/5. Made a brute, the civic person annihilated. Madison called enslaved people members of society "not as a part of the irrational creation." Douglass used the same distinction from lived experience.</p>
<p>When slaveholders ranked enslaved people alongside livestock during estate valuations, Douglass named what was happening:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"moral and intellectual beings, in open contempt of their humanity, level at a blow with horses, sheep, horned cattle and swine... Personality swallowed up in the sordid idea of property! Manhood lost in chattelhood!"<sup id="fnref:2-62"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-62">62</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Moral and intellectual beings", the natural person acknowledged. "Levelled at a blow with horses", the civic person annihilated. Then two coinages that compress the entire framework into six words: <em>personality swallowed up in property</em> (the <em>persona</em> consumed by <em>res</em>), <em>manhood lost in chattelhood</em> (the natural person submerged in the legal classification).</p>
<p>Most striking is Douglass's formulation from his 1846 London speech: "God has given him an intellect; the slaveholder declares it shall not be cultivated. If his moral perception leads him in a course contrary to his value as property, the slaveholder declares he shall not exercise it."<sup id="fnref:2-63"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-63">63</a></sup> God gave the intellect, the faculty exists. The slaveholder forbids its cultivation, the right to exercise it is denied. This is Rutherforth's formulation, faculties retained, right to exercise them stripped, stated not by a philosopher reasoning about slavery in the abstract but by a man who had been forbidden to read. The convergence does not prove the framework "worked" as an intellectual system. It suggests the framework described something real enough that both the theorists and the subjected arrived at the same description.</p>
<p>And when Douglass addressed the three-fifths clause directly, in his 1860 Glasgow speech, he read it not as a measure of Black humanity but as a political penalty on slaveholders: "It is a downright disability laid upon the slaveholding States; one which deprives those States of two-fifths of their natural basis of representation."<sup id="fnref:2-64"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-64">64</a></sup> The 2/5 is taken from the state, not from the person. Douglass understood that the fraction measured civic standing, not human worth.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="slave-codes">What the Slave Codes Reveal</h2>
<p>The South Carolina code captures the entire framework in two clauses:</p>
<p><strong>The Humanity Clause:</strong> "Natural justice forbids that any person of what condition soever should be condemned unheard."<sup id="fnref:2-65"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-65">65</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>The Property Clause:</strong> "All Negroes and Indians... shall be deemed... chattels personal."<sup id="fnref:2-66"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-66">66</a></sup></p>
<p>As the codes put it: You could be a "human creature" for purposes of God (soul) and the gallows (moral accountability), but "chattel personal" for purposes of commerce (liberty) and the ballot (standing).</p>
<p>The 3/5 fraction aligned with this specific legal reality when it was written into the federal government. It counted the natural man while ignoring the civil man.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="women-children">The Women and Children Problem</h2>
<p>The most serious challenge to this framework: Women, children, and non-propertied men also lacked voting rights and full legal agency. Yet they were counted as 5/5 for apportionment. If the 2/5 deficit comes from lacking civic capacity, why were other disenfranchised groups counted fully?</p>
<p><strong>The answer lies in the distinction between exclusion from participation and exclusion from membership.</strong></p>
<p>Women, children, and non-propertied men were <em>inside</em> the civic body but not fully participating in it:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Women</strong> had <strong>Standing</strong> &mdash;  membership in the civic body through their households, recognized through the doctrine of "virtual representation." But they had restricted <strong>Liberty</strong> &mdash;  coverture limited their independent action. They were inside the body politic but constrained within it. Hooker describes women as under permanent tutelage: "all Women which had not Husbands nor Fathers to govern them, had their Tutors, without whose Authority there was no act which they did, warrantable."<sup id="fnref:2-67"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-67">67</a></sup> Diminished within membership, not excluded from it. Aristotle captures the graduated distinction: a woman has "but a weak" deliberative faculty, a child "an imperfect one," but a slave "can have no power of determination" at all.<sup id="fnref:2-68"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-68">68</a></sup> (A tension must be acknowledged: Aristotle's own theory held that some people were slaves <em>by nature</em>, their natural endowment was genuinely deficient, which contradicts this framework's core claim that natural endowment is retained under slavery. The Lockean and Grotian tradition that the Founders more directly drew on rejected Aristotle's natural-slave thesis: Rutherforth explicitly rejected Aristotle's natural-slave thesis,<sup id="fnref:2-69"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-69">69</a></sup> and Locke grounded slavery in forfeiture, not nature. This framework uses Aristotle for the graduated-capacity <em>structure</em> while relying on the contractarian tradition for the substance of its claim about retained natural personhood.)</li>
<li><strong>Children</strong> had <strong>Standing</strong> &mdash;  membership through their parents, recognized as future full participants, and developing <strong>Liberty</strong> that the age of reason would restore. Hooker places them alongside "Innocents" and "Mad-men" as those who lack "the use of right Reason to guide themselves" and therefore "have for their Guide the Reason that guideth other Men, which are Tutors over them."<sup id="fnref:2-70"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-70">70</a></sup> Their exclusion was temporary and developmental, not categorical.</li>
<li><strong>Non-propertied men</strong> could potentially acquire property, their exclusion was contingent, not definitional.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these groups had recognized membership in the polity. They were represented through household heads. Their participation was limited, but their belonging was not questioned.</p>
<p>Enslaved people were <em>categorically outside</em> the civic body:</p>
<ul>
<li>They were legally <em>res</em> (things), not persons</li>
<li>They were "chattels personal", property itself, not potential property-owners</li>
<li>Their exclusion was not temporary, developmental, or contingent, it was definitional</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The 2/5 isn't "can't vote." It's "not recognized as belonging to the civic body at all."</strong></p>
<p>The 5/5 vs. 3/5 gap doesn't measure participation rights. It measures membership in the civic body itself.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="free-black">The Free Black Corroboration</h2>
<p>This framework predicts that free Black people, who had liberty and some standing, should count as 5/5. And they did.</p>
<p>The constitutional text reads "three fifths of all <em>other</em> Persons", meaning enslaved people specifically, not all Black people. Free Black people, including those who owned property and voted in certain states, were counted fully for apportionment purposes.</p>
<p>The first federal census in 1790 proves how the government applied this in practice. The original census form collected six categories of data per household:<sup id="fnref:2-71"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-71">71</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>Name of head of family</li>
<li>Number of free white males age 16 and upward</li>
<li>Number of free white males under 16</li>
<li>Number of free white females</li>
<li><strong>Number of all other free persons</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number of slaves</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Category 5, "all other free persons", is where free Black Americans were counted. They were enumerated as <strong>free persons</strong>, full stop. Category 6, "Number of slaves", is the population to which the 3/5 rule applied. The census form itself, the first operational implementation of the Constitution's apportionment clause, drew the line at legal status, not race. Free Black people were "free persons." Enslaved people were "slaves." The 3/5 applied only to the second category. NARA's own research guide confirms that the 1790 and 1810 censuses listed free nonwhites as "all other free persons" with no further distinction, they were simply free.<sup id="fnref:2-72"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-72">72</a></sup></p>
<p>This is significant. If the 2/5 deficit were about race, free Black people should have been discounted too. They weren't. The deficit tracked <em>legal civic status</em>, not skin color, exactly as this framework predicts. Enslaved people, who were categorically outside the civic body, were discounted. Free Black people, who had <em>de jure</em> standing as free persons, were not.</p>
<p>An important caveat: free Black people's <em>practical</em> civic recognition and political standing were often severely curtailed. Madison himself describes them as "degraded from the rank &amp; rights of white persons."<sup id="fnref:2-73"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-73">73</a></sup> They had liberty but degraded standing. If this framework measured lived experience, free Black people should have been counted somewhere between 3/5 and 5/5. They weren't, they counted as 5/5. This tells us what the Constitution was actually measuring: <em>formal legal category</em> (free vs. enslaved), not the practical enjoyment of rights. The framework operates at the level of legal taxonomy, who the law recognized as belonging to the civic body in principle, however much practice fell short.</p>
<p>This doesn't mean race was irrelevant, race determined who could <em>be</em> enslaved in America. But the counting formula measured legal civic status, not racial category and not lived reality.</p>
<p>The legal architecture confirms this. The natural/civil distinction that made the 3/5 fraction thinkable was not built for African slavery. It was built by Romans who enslaved Gauls, Britons, Germans, Greeks, Egyptians, Jews, Syrians, Thracians, anyone they conquered. Roman slavery was colorblind. A blond Germanic tribesman and a dark-skinned Nubian stood on the same auction block, suffered the same <em>capitis deminutio maxima</em>, lost the same civic standing while retaining the same natural personhood. The word "slave" itself derives from "Slav", the Slavic peoples enslaved en masse during the medieval period, as white as any Englishman.</p>
<p>When Grotius, Puffendorf, and Blackstone wrote about slavery's legal architecture, persona vs. res, civic death, the natural/civil split, they were describing a system designed for a world where the slave could look identical to the master. The machinery for stripping civic personhood while preserving natural personhood predates racial slavery by two millennia. American slavery grafted race onto that pre-existing framework. Race determined who occupied the status. The framework determined what that status <em>meant</em>, what was lost and what was retained. The 3/5 fraction drew on legal categories built for Gallic captives in 200 AD and Slavic prisoners in 900 AD, not on any theory about African humanity. The architecture was race-neutral by design, because it was engineered by people who enslaved people who looked just like them.</p>

<h2 id="civil-structure">The Civil 2/5 Is a Structure, Not a Fixed Definition</h2>
<p>The natural 3/5, body, soul, mind, is stable across centuries. What it means to have a body, a soul, and a rational mind did not change from Aristotle to Madison. But the civil 2/5 is not static. The <em>structure</em> holds, there is always a civic layer on top of the natural person, and that civic layer is always what gets manipulated, but the <em>content</em> poured into that structure shifted as power changed hands.</p>

<p>The architecture never changed. A natural person underneath, a civic status on top. What <em>defined</em> the civic status, what got you in or kept you out, changed to serve whoever held power:</p>
<ul>
<li>When the Church defined the commonwealth, the civic criterion was <strong>religion</strong>. Heathens could be enslaved; Christians could not. Elizabeth Key won her freedom in 1655 on this logic. Virginia spent sixty years (1667-1727) legislating the soul's civic weight out of existence to protect slavery.</li>
<li>When the state consolidated power over the Church, the civic criterion became <strong>legal status</strong>, free vs. enslaved, and that status was mapped onto <strong>race</strong>. The 1705 code marks the transition: "not Christians in their native country" is half religious, half national, catching the handoff mid-stride.</li>
<li>When emancipation destroyed the legal category, the civic criterion became <strong>social belonging</strong>, enforced through law (Black Codes, Jim Crow) and custom (segregation, economic exclusion). Madison predicted this in 1819: freed people would face "a privation of that moral rank &amp; those social blessings."<sup id="fnref:2-74"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-74">74</a></sup> Legal freedom without social belonging.</li>
<li>The machine is still running. Felony disenfranchisement is <em>capitis deminutio</em> in modern dress. A convicted felon loses the right to vote, hold office, serve on juries, and in many states possess firearms, civic death by another name. The natural person persists. What is stripped is liberty (imprisoned) and standing (disenfranchised). In many states, prisoners are counted for apportionment in the district where they are imprisoned, not where they lived, inflating the political power of rural districts while the prisoners themselves cannot vote. They are counted but do not count.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="thesis">The Thesis</h2>
<p><strong>The 3/5 fraction measured civic belonging, not humanity.</strong></p>
<p>Natural humanity (body, soul, mind) was undeniable, the slave codes themselves recognized it. Civic belonging (liberty, standing) was denied, the slave codes explicitly stripped it.</p>
<p>The framework doesn't claim Madison sat down and listed five components. It claims the 3/5 fraction aligned with a philosophical architecture already present in:
- Lockean social contract theory (pre-political human condition vs. civic membership)
- Blackstone's legal categories (natural vs. civil capacity; "man as a creature" vs. "man as a citizen")
- The slave codes themselves (human creature vs. chattel personal)
- Theological debates about baptism (soul vs. civic standing)
- Roman legal doctrine (persona vs. res; capitis deminutio as graduated civic death)
- Puffendorf's layered personhood ("Man and Citizen" as separable identities; "a slave is a man for all that")
- Hooker's triple state ("a natural, a civil, and a spiritual")
- Madison's own vocabulary ("moral rank," "rank &amp; rights," "divested of two fifths of the MAN," and the five-part enumeration in the "Property" essay)
- The constitutional text itself (free Black people counted fully; enslaved people did not)</p>
<p>This alignment explains why fractional counting felt defensible. It mapped onto how educated 18th-century minds already thought about personhood, the distinction between the natural human everyone acknowledged and the civic member the law refused to recognize.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="historiography">Engaging the Historiography</h2>
<p>This framework exists within a scholarly conversation about the Three-Fifths Clause, and intellectual honesty requires engaging with the strongest competing interpretations.</p>
<h3>The Political-Power Reading (Wills, Rakove)</h3>
<p>Garry Wills (<em>"Negro President"</em>) argues the 3/5 clause was primarily a mechanism for inflating Southern political power, a raw deal that gave slaveholders disproportionate representation in Congress and the Electoral College.<sup id="fnref:2-75"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-75">75</a></sup> Jack Rakove (<em>Original Meanings</em>) emphasizes the contingency and messiness of the Convention, arguing that many constitutional provisions were ad hoc compromises rather than principled architectures.<sup id="fnref:2-76"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-76">76</a></sup></p>
<p>Neither scholar would dispute the natural/civil distinction in philosophy. The disagreement is about whether that distinction <em>explains</em> the fraction or merely <em>coexists</em> with it. Wills and Rakove would say: the fraction was a political artifact; the philosophical tradition was background noise. This framework says: the political negotiation produced a number, but the philosophical tradition is what made that number feel defensible rather than arbitrary.</p>
<p>These claims are not mutually exclusive. The fraction was a political deal <em>and</em> it aligned with a philosophical architecture. The political reading explains why the fraction was <em>adopted</em>. The philosophical reading explains why it was <em>thinkable</em>, why counting human beings as fractions did not strike these men as conceptually absurd. Both can be true simultaneously.</p>
<h3>The Social Death Reading (Patterson)</h3>
<p>Orlando Patterson's <em>Slavery and Social Death</em> (1982) studied slavery across 66 societies, Roman, Greek, Islamic, African, Caribbean, American, and found that despite vast cultural differences, slavery everywhere shared three structural features: <em>natal alienation</em> (the slave is cut off from all claims of birth, no legally recognized parents, children, or ancestors), <em>generalized dishonor</em> (the slave exists in a permanent state of degradation that constitutively defines the master's honor), and <em>domination grounded in the threat of violence</em> (the master's power over the slave's body is unlimited in principle).<sup id="fnref:2-77"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-77">77</a></sup> Patterson's term for this total condition is "social death." The slave is biologically alive but socially nonexistent.</p>
<p>Patterson's framework and this one are more complementary than competing. Patterson demonstrates that the natural/civil split is not merely a Western philosophical abstraction, it describes something real about slavery as a human institution. Every slave society, whether or not it read Locke, ended up acknowledging the slave's biological humanity (you cannot extract labor from a corpse) while denying social membership. Patterson provides the cross-cultural sociology. This framework provides the specific intellectual history that shaped how the American constitutional order categorized that social death. The "2/5 stripped", liberty and standing, is the Madisonian vocabulary for what Patterson calls social death. The convergence matters: if the natural/civil distinction appears not just in Western philosophy but in the structural logic of slavery across civilizations, then the framework describes something deeper than one tradition's idiosyncrasy.</p>
<h3>The Intellectual History Reading (Davis)</h3>
<p>David Brion Davis (<em>The Problem of Slavery in Western Culture</em>, 1966) asked the harder question: How did societies that explicitly committed themselves to human equality and natural rights, Enlightenment Europe, revolutionary America, continue to practice slavery without cognitive collapse?<sup id="fnref:2-78"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-78">78</a></sup> His answer, across five hundred pages: the Western intellectual tradition contained <em>built-in escape hatches</em>. From Aristotle's "natural slaves" through Christian theology's distinction between spiritual equality and temporal hierarchy, through Locke's theory that the slave forfeits rights through aggression, the tradition always had a way to acknowledge universal humanity <em>in principle</em> while denying it <em>in practice</em>. The contradiction was not a failure of the system. It was a feature. The tradition was engineered to hold both positions simultaneously.</p>
<p>Davis documents exactly the tension this framework describes: the acknowledgment of the slave's natural humanity alongside the denial of civic standing. What this framework adds is a narrowing of Davis's broad observation to a specific claim about the 3/5 fraction and the texts available to the Convention delegates. Davis shows the tradition <em>enabled</em> the contradiction. The framework argues the 3/5 fraction aligned with the architecture of that contradiction, the point where "all men are created equal" meets "chattels personal," and the legal system needs a number to reconcile them. Blackstone's creature/citizen distinction, Locke's forfeiture theory, Grotius's voluntary self-alienation, these were not blind spots in the tradition. They were load-bearing walls in an intellectual architecture built to accommodate slavery within a rights-based system. The 3/5 fraction fit that accommodation when a number was needed.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="objections">Objections and Responses</h2>
<h3>"Madison was just splitting the difference between 1/2 and 3/4."</h3>
<p>The arithmetic is imprecise. The midpoint between Harrison's 1/2 (0.50) and the New Englanders' 3/4 (0.75) is 5/8 (0.625), not 3/5 (0.60). In fact, 2/3 (0.667) would have been closer to the midpoint. 2/3 <em>was</em> voted on at the Convention and failed 6-5. Then 3/5 passed 9-2.</p>
<p>However: the objection has force when understood through the lens of political focal points rather than exact midpoints. Thomas Schelling's concept of focal points describes how negotiators converge on numbers that feel "natural" or salient even when the mathematical midpoint differs.<sup id="fnref:2-79"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-79">79</a></sup> 3/5 may have functioned as a focal point, a "clean" fraction that felt like a reasonable landing zone. The framework's response is not that focal-point dynamics are wrong but that they are incomplete: the question is <em>why</em> 3/5 felt natural or salient. A fraction that happened to align with the deepest structural distinction in the philosophical tradition these men shared would have a salience that 5/8 or 7/12 would not.</p>
<p>More fundamentally, Blackstone's creature/citizen distinction is a structural binary, not a sliding scale. Man has two separable statuses, natural being and civic being, and the slave retains one while the other is destroyed. The 3/5 maps onto a structural division rather than landing on a point along a negotiating spectrum: the "Human Creature" (three natural components) remains after the law strips away the "Citizen" (two civic components).</p>
<h3>"Why exactly five components? You reverse-engineered 5 because the denominator is 5."</h3>
<p>A fair objection and the framework's most vulnerable structural point. Does the decomposition derive from the sources, or from the fraction itself?</p>
<p>The defense rests on four points:</p>
<p><strong>First, the natural/civil binary is independently attested.</strong> The distinction between natural personhood and civic membership is the foundational structure of Locke, Blackstone, Grotius, Puffendorf, Hooker, the slave codes, and Roman law. That binary exists regardless of what fraction the Founders chose.</p>
<p><strong>Second, the specific components come from the sources, not from the math.</strong> Body, soul, and mind come from Christian theology (1 Thessalonians 5:23: "spirit and soul and body"), the baptism debates, and slave code jurisprudence. Liberty and standing come from Locke's and Blackstone's legal categories, and from Madison's own vocabulary in the "Property" essay, the Coles letter ("moral rank &amp; social blessings"), and the Lafayette letter ("rank &amp; rights"). The framework maps pre-existing categories, it does not invent components to fill slots. Rutherforth independently produces the same structure: faculties retained, right to exercise them stripped. Puffendorf's <em>De Officio Hominis et Civis</em>, whose very title separates "Man" from "Citizen", produces it again.</p>
<p><strong>Third, the framework predicts things it shouldn't if it were just curve-fitting.</strong> Most importantly: free Black people should count as 5/5. And they did. The 1790 census confirms it. Women should count as 5/5 (standing without full liberty). They did. If this were pure retrofitting, it would not have generated testable predictions that the historical record confirms.</p>
<p><strong>Fourth, the "Property" essay provides independent evidence.</strong> Madison's 1792 enumeration of what a man has property in, opinions, religious opinions, safety of person, free use of faculties, free choice of objects, produces a five-part list that maps onto the framework without being designed to. Three natural attributes, two civic exercises. This essay was not about the Three-Fifths Compromise. Madison was writing about property rights. The convergence is unprompted.</p>
<p>The honest limitation: you could decompose the natural person differently (body + soul = 2; or body + soul + mind + will = 4) and get different numbers. The framework's claim is that the body/soul/mind decomposition is the one most strongly attested across the specific traditions these men knew, Pauline theology, classical philosophy, the slave codes, and that the liberty/standing decomposition is the one that appears in every relevant political philosopher. But the numerological precision should not be overstated. The point is the structural claim: natural personhood retained, civic personhood stripped. Whether you call that 3/5 or "the natural remainder after civic annihilation," the architecture is what matters more than the arithmetic.</p>
<h3>"The productivity explanation is sufficient. Madison said it was about labor value."</h3>
<p>Madison's 1783 diary gives a one-sentence productivity rationale: slave labor produces 3/5 of what free labor produces. But this explanation has three problems:</p>
<p><strong>First</strong>, the same fraction was applied to representation in 1787, where productivity is irrelevant. An enslaved infant contributes zero labor value but was still counted at 3/5 for congressional apportionment. Nobody recalculated the number when the purpose changed from taxation to representation.</p>
<p>A contingency-based counterargument is available: they recycled the number from 1783 out of convenience, not because it fit a philosophical scheme. Path dependence is a simpler explanation. This counterargument has force, bureaucratic inertia is real.</p>
<p><strong>Second</strong>, when Madison rationalized the fraction four years later in Federalist 54, he reached for philosophical vocabulary, not economic vocabulary. He wrote "divested of two fifths of the MAN", not "valued at three fifths of a laborer." He called the slave "a moral person, not as a mere article of property" and "a member of the society, not as a part of the irrational creation." "Divested" is the exact term from Hobbes, Locke, and Grotius for the stripping of rights. If the fraction were purely an economic artifact, the economic vocabulary was available and more precise. Madison chose philosophical categories instead. That choice does not prove the fraction was philosophically derived, but it does show that the philosophical framework was the one Madison found most natural for explaining it.</p>
<p><strong>Third</strong>, if the fraction measured economic productivity, slaveholders should have wanted to <em>increase</em> their slaves' productive capacity through education and skill development. Instead, the opposite: they systematically suppressed it. Douglass testifies from lived experience: "God has given him an intellect; the slaveholder declares it shall not be cultivated."<sup id="fnref:2-80"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2-80">80</a></sup> The slaveholder deliberately reduces the slave's productivity by forbidding education. This makes no sense under a productivity theory. It makes sense under a civic-death theory: the slave's <em>natural</em> capacities (intellect, moral perception) are acknowledged as existing, but the <em>right to exercise them</em> is denied, because exercise implies agency, and agency implies standing.</p>

<p>The anachronism charge would apply if the framework used terms like "human rights," "dignity," "intersectionality," or "structural racism." It does not. It uses "body," "soul," "mind," "liberty," "standing," "divested," "rank," "creature," and "citizen", all terms that appear in the primary sources these men read and wrote.</p>
<h3>"The silence at the Convention proves nothing."</h3>
<p>This objection is correct, and the framework should not overclaim. The silence is genuinely ambiguous. It is <em>consistent with</em> the tacit-framework interpretation (you don't explain what everyone already knows) but also <em>consistent with</em> the contingency interpretation (nobody justified the fraction philosophically because the fraction was political, not philosophical). The silence alone proves neither reading. What makes the tacit-framework reading worth considering is not the silence itself but the combined weight of the surrounding evidence: the philosophical tradition, the slave codes, Madison's vocabulary, the "Property" essay enumeration, and the free Black corroboration. The silence is a gap that the framework fills plausibly, not a gap that confirms the framework.</p>
<h3>What Would Falsify This Framework?</h3>
<p>If this argument asks to be taken seriously, it should say what would change its mind.</p>
<p>Evidence that would undercut the framework:
1. A Convention-era document that grounds the 3/5 fraction in a productivity calculation with actual data and methodology. Madison's 1783 diary entry does offer a productivity rationale, one sentence, no data, no methodology, and this framework must acknowledge that it exists. But the rationale is so thin (a single unsupported assertion) and was never revisited when the fraction's purpose changed from taxation to representation. If a detailed empirical study were found, one that derived 3/5 from economic data without reference to the person/property dualism, it would significantly weaken the framework's claim that the fraction aligned with a philosophical architecture rather than an economic calculation.
2. A statutory regime that treats enslaved people consistently as property-only (no moral agency, no criminal responsibility, no religious instruction) yet still produces comparable fractional counting.
3. Evidence that the philosophical sources Madison knew (Locke, Blackstone, Grotius, Puffendorf) do NOT contain the natural/civil distinction, that this binary was invented by later scholars and projected backward.
4. Proof that free Black people were NOT counted as 5/5 under the apportionment clause, which would break the framework's most testable prediction.</p>
<p>None of this evidence exists in strong form. The closest candidate, Madison's 1783 productivity sentence, is too thin to constitute an alternative explanation on its own, but the framework should not pretend it does not exist.</p>
<h3>Limitations</h3>
<p>This framework does not claim:
- That Madison sat down and listed five components of personhood
- That the 3/5 fraction was a deliberate philosophical encoding
- That body, soul, and mind each "equal" one-fifth of a person
- That the five-part structure is the only valid reading of these sources
- That the philosophical architecture <em>caused</em> the delegates to choose 3/5 rather than another fraction</p>
<p>It claims that the fraction aligned with a philosophical architecture already present in the tradition, an architecture so deeply absorbed that it shaped intuitions about what numbers felt defensible without anyone needing to articulate the mapping. The "Property" essay suggests the alignment was more than coincidental, but the framework's core contribution is not the numerology. It is the identification of the intellectual architecture that made fractional counting of human beings thinkable to men who believed in natural rights.</p>

<p><strong>The 3/5 Compromise counted the natural man while ignoring the civil man.</strong></p>
<hr />
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Three-Fifths Compromise wasn't about whether enslaved people were human. Everyone knew they were. The slave codes acknowledged their humanity explicitly, that's why they could be tried for crimes, why their souls could be saved, why "natural justice" applied to them.</p>
<p>It was about whether they belonged to the civic body. The answer was no. They were "inhabitants" but not members. "Human creatures" but "chattels personal." "Moral persons" but not civic participants.</p>
<p>Madison called the slave "a moral person, not as a mere article of property" and "a member of the society, not as a part of the irrational creation." He described freedom without civic standing as worth "less than half" its full value. He used the word "divested", the exact term of art from the natural-law tradition, to describe what slavery removed. And when he described what free Black people faced even after emancipation, he used a different word: "degrade." Not stripped, degraded. "Disqualifications which degrade them from the rank &amp; rights of white persons." Rank and rights, two civic things. For the enslaved, divested entirely. For free Black people, not removed but diminished. Madison saw the difference. The framework must too.</p>
<p>Free Black people who had liberty and some standing counted as 5/5 under the Constitution, the formula measured legal category, not lived reality. Women and children who had standing counted fully. Enslaved people, categorically outside the polity, did not.</p>
<p>This framework doesn't make the compromise less morally repugnant. It makes it more so, by revealing the intellectual architecture that let educated Christians who believed in natural rights convince themselves that owning humans was compatible with their principles.</p>
<p>They didn't deny the humanity. They denied the membership.</p>
